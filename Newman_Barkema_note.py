1) basic concepts:

1.1) ground state
1.2) degenerate state
1.3) Hamiltonian system (H=KE+V) 


2) key concepts:(need to be memorized)
2.1) microcanonical ensemble: [NVE system]
For a classical system which has a continuum of energy states there can be a continuous
set of degenerate states through which the system passes, and an average over those states
can sometimes give a good answer for certain properties of the system. Such sets of
degenerate states are said to form a microcanonical ensemble. 

2.2) canonical ensembe[NVT system, with a heat bath]
The more general case we consider here, in which there is a thermal reservoir causing the energy of the system
to fluctuate, is known as a canonical ensemble.

2.3) master equationS from one state to anther

dwµ/dt = Sum[wν(t)R(ν → µ) − wµ(t)R(µ → ν)], where Sum(wu)=1




3) English:
3.1) synopsis: summary, outline, main idea
3.2) paradim: model
3.3) continuum: a continuum of energy states
3.4) sheer: completed, sheer number of 
3.5) probabilistic treatment
